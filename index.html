      <p id="description">My City</p>
      <p> I graduated with a Finance degree in 2007 and a Marketing degree in 2015. unfourtunately, I am just a house wife. That's why I am joining with code your future. I feel well planned to take my career to the next level, so that’s why I’m at present looking for an innovative opportunity. </p><br>
      <p>Currently I am living in chealsea. Here is a small introdustion of my city.
Chelsea is an affluent area in west London, England, situated south-west of the City of Westminster. It lies on the north bank of the River Thames and for postal purposes is part of the south-western postal area.</p><br>
      <p>Chelsea historically formed an ancient parish in the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex, which became a metropolitan borough of the former County of London in 1900. It merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Kensington, forming the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea upon the formation of the Greater London area in 1965.
The exclusivity of Chelsea as a result of its high property prices historically resulted in the coining of the term "Sloane Ranger" in the 1970s to describe some of its residents, and some of those of nearby areas.</p><br>
